# iOS Plugins and Tooling

Suggested tooling for modern iOS projects:

## Code Quality
- SwiftLint for style enforcement.
- SwiftFormat for formatting.
- Periphery for unused code detection.

## Project Generation
- XcodeGen for deterministic project files.
- Tuist for modular builds and caching.

## CI/CD and Release
- fastlane for CI and App Store uploads.
- xcbeautify for readable xcodebuild logs.

## Testing
- SnapshotTesting for UI regression (use sparingly).
- Mocking frameworks when protocol stubs are insufficient.

## Observability
- Structured logging frameworks with privacy annotations.
- Crash reporting and performance monitoring tools.
