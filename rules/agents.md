# Agents

Use specialized agents when:
- Planning multi-step features -> planner
- Designing architecture -> architect
- Writing tests first -> tdd-guide
- Reviewing code -> code-reviewer
- Fixing build errors -> build-error-resolver
- Security audit -> security-reviewer
- Large refactors -> refactor-cleaner
- Updating docs -> doc-updater
- E2E flows -> e2e-runner
