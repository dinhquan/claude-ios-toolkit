# Git Workflow

## Commit Hygiene
- Use Conventional Commits.
- Keep commits small and focused.
- Avoid mixing refactors with behavior changes.
- Do not commit secrets or certificates.

## PR Expectations
- Include test notes in PR description.
- Call out risky changes and mitigations.
- Link to relevant issues or tasks.

## Examples
```
feat(ios): add onboarding analytics
fix(ui): prevent layout overflow on iPhone SE
refactor(data): isolate profile caching
```
