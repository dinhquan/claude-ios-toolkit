# iOS Refactor Clean

Remove dead code and simplify Swift/SwiftUI implementations without behavior changes.

## Steps
1. Identify unused files, assets, and strings.
2. Remove dead code and duplicate logic.
3. Simplify view hierarchies and view models.
4. Update tests if needed to reflect structure changes.

## Guardrails
- Keep changes minimal and behavior-preserving.
- Prefer deletion of unused assets to reduce size.
- Avoid stylistic rewrites unless they improve clarity.
