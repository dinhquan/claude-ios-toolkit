# iOS Test Coverage

Analyze XCTest coverage and close gaps in critical logic.

## Steps
1. Run tests with coverage enabled.
2. Identify untested critical paths.
3. Add tests for business logic and state transitions.
4. Prioritize stability and determinism.

## Guidance
- Favor unit and integration tests over UI tests.
- Avoid brittle snapshot tests unless required.
- Track coverage by module, not just overall percentage.
