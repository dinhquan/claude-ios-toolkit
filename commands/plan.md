# iOS Plan

Create a plan for Swift/SwiftUI implementation that is explicit about architecture and testing.

## Plan Requirements
1. Identify affected targets, modules, and files.
2. Describe the data flow (models, view models, services).
3. Outline UI updates and navigation changes.
4. Specify testing strategy (unit, integration, XCUITest).
5. Call out risks (migrations, permissions, threading).

## Output Format
- Goal
- Scope (files/targets)
- Step-by-step plan
- Tests and validation
- Risks and mitigations
