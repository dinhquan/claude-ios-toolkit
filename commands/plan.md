# iOS Plan

Plan a Swift/SwiftUI implementation:

1. Identify affected targets and files
2. Define data flow (models, view models, services)
3. Outline UI changes and navigation
4. Add test strategy (XCTest/XCUITest)
5. Call out risks (migrations, permissions, threads)

Deliver a numbered plan with scope and tests.
